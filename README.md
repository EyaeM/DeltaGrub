# DeltaGRUB

A Deltarune-themed GRUB bootloader theme.

## Origin of the Project

Ive always loved Deltarune and for the past few weeks have been searching for a deltarune grub theme, I found an undertale one called [Grubtale](https://github.com/lazypwny751/grubtale) But not a deltarune one.
So I asked in the Arch Linux discord whether there was a GRUB theme for Deltarune out there. They said if you want one, make it yourself. So here we are a complete amateur making a GRUB theme by forking off [MineGrub](https://github.com/Lxtharia/minegrub-world-sel-theme/tree/dev) and modifying it until it is way shitter but Deltarune themed.
(I have no idea what I'm doing so if you wanna help out your welcome to!)
